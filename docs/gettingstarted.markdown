## Export or gather data from your system of record

Your program likely captures the data ECE Reporter is requesting in a system of record such as ChildPlus, Powerschool or paper records. If you have IT support, they may be able to provide assistance in setting up a custom report from your system of record. Making a custom report can save you a lot of time and is highly recommended!


## Enter data in the template

Based on [OEC’s data requirements](https://ece-reporter.ctoec.org/data-requirements), enter your enrollment data in OEC’s template.  \
Keep a few things in mind:



*   Add all the enrollment data you manage to [OEC’s data template](https://ece-reporter.ctoec.org/template). You cannot use any other file to upload data to ECE Reporter.
*   If you upload a file to ECE Reporter, you will erase any data for the sites you’re uploading data to. To keep things simple, make sure your data is as close to done as possible before uploading.
*   ECE Reporter will check your data and prompt you to resolve any errors
*   If you need to make small updates, don’t worry! All of the data can be edited in the ECE Reporter tool 


See the example below for a completed enrollment that does not have any enrollment changes (more information on enrollments with changes in the following steps).

### Format specific data fields if needed

Sometimes your system of record may export specific data, such as dates,  in a format not accepted in ECE Reporter’s data template. 

If you’re using Microsoft Excel, here are a few resources for formatting data:



*   [Format a date the way you want it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/format-a-date-the-way-you-want-8e10019e-d5d8-47a1-ba95-db95123d273e)
*   [Split data in a cell](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/split-a-cell-f1804d0c-e180-4ed0-a2ae-973a0b7c6a23)
*   [Finding and replacing text](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/find-or-replace-text-and-numbers-on-a-worksheet-0e304ca5-ecef-4808-b90f-fdb42f892e90#ID0EACAAA=Windows)
*   [Find more excel help here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/excel)
*   Note: If your export removes the leading 0 from zipcodes, don’t worry, ECE Reporter considers that an acceptable format for zipcodes!


### Add enrollments that have changed

ECE Reporter collects enrollment data from 07/01/2020 to 12/31/2020. You will need to upload enrollment and funding changes from that time period. This section will show you how to add those historical updates to ECE Reporter.

Changes you’ll need to add in ECE Reporter are:



*   Changes to enrolled site
*   Changes to age group
*   Changes to funding types

To add changes:



1. Create a row with the most recent enrollment data for the child
2. Fill in all required fields in that row
3. Create another row for the child’s past enrollment(s)
4. Make sure all fields in the child identifiers section match for every row for that child
5. In the new row, add changes in the enrollment and funding section to indicate past enrollment data
6. All other fields can be blank for the enrollment update row

See the examples below for a child enrollment that has had changes between July 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020.

### Add enrollments that have been withdrawn

You’ll need to upload any enrollment that has withdrawn between July 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. 

The example below shows what a withdrawn record looks like in OEC’s template.
