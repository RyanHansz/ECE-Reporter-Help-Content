# How to delete a child’s record
Use this feature when you’ve mistakenly added a child record to ECE Reporter. Do not use this feature when you’d like to withdraw or change enrollments.

## Step 1: Navigate to your roster
Click the Roster link in the top left of ECE Reporter, in the menu below the logo.

## Step 2: Find the record to be deleted from your roster
When you find the record you’d like to delete, click on the child’s name to open their enrollment record.


### Step 3: Delete the child record
Find and click the delete link in the top-right section of the child’s record.
Note: Deleting a record will permanently remove all data.
